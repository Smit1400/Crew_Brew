# Crew_Brew
This app is made using Flutter. It's a coffee app to store users preferences about coffee like sugar,etc . It can be used in companies by employees

#### We can use this app in companies, colleges where employees dosen't need to specify his/his referenced everytime he/she go the canteen instead one can `login` into the 'app' choose number of sugar, strength of the coffee and they are good to go.
#### Now since the caffee manager has the preferences of the employees they can deliver the coffee to them without asking their preferences everytime.
#### Also the employee's i.e. users can change their prefernces at any point of time.

### > To run the app

> `cd into Crew_Brew`
#### and then
> `flutter run`

Make sure you have flutter path set in your environment for successfull working of the app.
